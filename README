Welcome to the PHP-json-post-send-read-check-notify-in-bash-and-php wiki!

 -Project Scope: To send some text data from diferent servers to one server that will parse the requests and notify via email with no additional 
  programs. 
 -Project in production scope: I have multiple linux servers that make backups every day and notify me on email, now I have too many servers to monitor 
  and I decide to make a "backup monitoring and notification of multiple servers" by make every server at the end of backup process to send JSON POST 
  Request to specified server that will check all responses once per day and notify me who is Success and who is Fail. In that way I will check only one 
  email to see Backup jobs status of every server.

What is need for this to work:

1. Debian/Unbuntu (Other not tested, but should work), PHP 5 (Other not tested, but should work).
2. Upload json-read.php script to root of web server folder that will have the "CHECKER ROLE" (Ex.: /var/www/backup). When some server send Json Post 
   request, this php script will write the Data to a file called: result_*.txt.
3. On servers that you need to send Json Post PHP Request we need to upload and then run the json-send.php or json-send.sh. You can choice Bash or PHP 
   script.
4. Script called check.sh will check all the result_*.txt in directory for a Keyword - SERVER 1 OK (You can change the keyword at start of the script).
5. To secure your folder on server where read.php is situated, need to deny indexing of root web directory to do so, open bash terminal and do:
     cd /etc/apache2/
     nano apache2.conf or httpd.conf
     Find and edit /var/www section in apache2.conf like this:
   #
   <Directory /var/www>
     Options -Indexes
     AllowOverride All
     Order allow,deny
     Allow from all
   </Directory>
   #
   Save and Close apache2.conf
   service apache2 restart

6. To avoid reading of script by others, you can put check.sh in another directory then /var/www and indicate path to read.php 
   ex:/var/www/server.admin.md/backup/
